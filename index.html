<h1>About {{ site.title[page.lang] }}</h1>

<p>This website is intended to provide a personal experience report on the
  Master of Computer Science at KIT, best practices in dealing with
  administration/deadlines/etc and a collection place for lecture scripts.</p>

<p>The motivation for this comes from the fact that you can put a lot of energy in
lecture summaries and exercise sheets, but then they are archived on the computer.
And we would have liked to have found more detailed information about the course of studies
before applying for the master at KIT.</p>

<p>It was not possible to find easy accessible information whether it is possible to get
  accepted with your average grade or not.</p>
